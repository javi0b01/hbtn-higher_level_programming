## Learning Objectives
###### Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.
###### General
* Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions
